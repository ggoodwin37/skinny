- [ ] console.performance?
- [ ] brush up on xss, csrf, others? clickjacking?
- [ ] minesweeper
- [ ] Reading
  - [ ] http://research.google.com/pubs/DistributedSystemsandParallelComputing.html
  - [ ] https://projecteuler.net/archives
  - [ ] http://www.aosabook.org/en/distsys.html
- [ ] All s-components should get basic functionality for free (title, descr, back link)
- [ ] Ability to mark a certain component as done or todo so we can put unsolved problems in here.

## Bugs
- [ ] Saw this bug after going to hanoi then back to root: app.js:46039 Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op. Please check the code for the HanoiComponent component.
